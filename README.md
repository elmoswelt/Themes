##Dizzko Themes

Just a small collection of color themes for Xcode and co. As I spend my whole day in Xcode, terminal and TextMate I will collect my custom themes here. Please note, that this is work in progress and I will adjust these when I find some time. 

I use the open source font ***Source Code Pro*** for my editors. You can find it [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sourcecodepro.adobe/).
